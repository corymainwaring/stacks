Stacks
======

A task-management system that uses a stack concept for organizing work. The goal of the Stacks system is to get work broken down into manageable chunks that can
be accomplished in one sitting. To achieve this, task splitting is core to the functionality. If a task winds up taking more than one sitting to complete, break
it down into multiple tasks by splitting them out. When picking up work, Stacks relies on pushing things down the stack and pulling them up the stack, allowing
you to work on the next best item. Dependencies between tasks can be used to filter out tasks you can't do yet, with all supporting tasks forced to be higher up
in the stack than the dependent task. If a task with dependencies is lifted up the stack, all dependent tasks will pop up with it.

Philosophy
----------

Why stacks is better:

* Sense of momentum and accomplishment
* Better estimates (all project items are broken into individual tasks of roughly equal sizes)
* Tasks exploding in time instead explode in task count
* The next thing to work on is always readily available. Just pick up from the top of the stack
